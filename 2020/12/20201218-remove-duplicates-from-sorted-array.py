# Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place
# such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
#
# Do not allocate extra space for another array,
# you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,1,2]
# Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
# Explanation: Your function should return length = 2,
# with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
# It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
# Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
# Explanation: Your function should return length = 5,
# with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
# It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# nums is sorted in ascending order.
